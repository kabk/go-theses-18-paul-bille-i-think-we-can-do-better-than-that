<h1>Beta Abstract 1</h1>

<h1>1. What subject or subject field are you interested in?</h1>


<p>Growth is not only live itself—it is also a deeply embed process in (Western) society. I am interested in how the desire to constantly grow drives our daily lives. On a cosmic level it is the never ending expansion of the universe. On an economical level it is the driving force of capitalism which produces a $600 wifi-connected-juice-press. And on a personal level it is the voice in the back of your head telling you that you better buy it because that juice might be healthy for you. I want to look at growth from all angles. How does growth keep producing innovative juice presses and can it still our thirst?</p>

<h1>2. Why do you want to explore this subject?</h1>


<p>I am the designer who potentially makes the Facebook-ad popping up in your news feed, telling you about a new juice-press. But I am also the guy who potentially makes the YouTube video that tells you that you can squeeze out the packs of mushed carrots that come with it by hand instead of using the press at all. I am wondering, what my role is as a designer in a society where everyone is in constant need to design every aspect of their lives. And if it would also be OK to just by juice from the supermarket.</p>

<h1>3. What do you want to find out about this subject?</h1>


<p>You live in an age of endless possibilities. Your current society does not only change at an accelerating speed through more and more technological developments. Your ever mediated environment forces you also to ask yourself if it is cool to eat meat, if your job is fulfilling, if you should break with your religious affiliation or gender binary. In this environment your perception of reality stays constantly questioned in favor of the possibilities which surround you. This keeps you busy—Improving, Perfecting, Streamlining, Innovating. And of course You think you can do better than that. You could build more applications and integrate more features which help you to measure, quantify and understand you and your surroundings. Or you throw away all of these shiny toys and go on a detox with a monk in the mountains of Tibet. You could also start complaining that everything was better back in the days. Better could mean more of everything or less of everything or maybe both of it. Today I would like to look into the manifold ways of living which the age of possibilities holds prepared for you, how they increasingly put you in need to decide and design for yourself and of course how the big bad guys exploit this situation.</p>

<h1>4. How might you go about finding this out/exploring this subject?</h1>

<p>Mapping out the bend points of „growth“ as a life encompassing term is a pretty complex job. To make my live a little easier I want focus on a handful of oppositions which seem to be crucial aspects of our lives in terms of pushing the limits of what is possible. Vice versa I am interested in how they define what is normal. These oppositions are:</p>

EXTREME vs NORM<br>
GOOD vs BETTER<br>
INDIVIDUAL vs COLLECTIVE<br>
BORING vs EXCITEMENT<br>
SIMPLE vs COMPLEXITY<br>
PRIVACY vs PUBLIC<br>
PRODUCTIVITY vs LEISURE<br>
SUCCESS vs FAILURE<br>
FUNCTION vs DISFUNCTION<br>
ACCIDENTAL vs DETERMINATION
