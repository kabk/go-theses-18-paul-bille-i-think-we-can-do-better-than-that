			<h2>The Age of Unworldliness</h2>

			<p>Growth is not only life itself—it is also a deeply embed process in (Western) society. You are interested in how the desire to constantly grow drives your daily live. On a cosmic level it is the neverending expansion of the universe. On an economical level it is the driving force of capitalism which produces a $600 wifi-connected-juice-press. And on a personal level it is the voice in the back of your head telling you that you better buy it because that juice might be healthy for you. Time to look at growth from all angles. How does growth keep producing innovative juice presses and can it still your thirst?</p>

			<p>Your thirst in this case is my thirst because from now on You are Me and from now on You have to deal with the things I deal. Potentially it is helpful from time to time to remember that You are Me. You are part of what they call Generation-Y. You are not really sure what that Y means but that is probably a part of it.</p>

			<p>You are the designer who potentially makes the Facebook-ad popping up in my news feed, telling me about a new juice-press. But you are also the guy who potentially makes the YouTube video that tells me that I can squeeze out the packs of mashed carrots that come with it by hand instead of using the press at all. You are wondering, what is your role as a designer in a society where everyone is in constant need to design every aspect of their lives. And if it would also be OK to just buy juice from the supermarket.</p>

			<p>You live in an age of endless possibilities. Your current society does not only change at an accelerating speed through more and more technological developments. Your ever mediated environment forces you also to ask yourself if it is cool to eat meat, if your job is fulfilling, if you should break with your religious affiliation or gender binary. In this environment your perception of reality stays constantly questioned in favor of the possibilities which surround you. This keeps you busy—Improving, Perfecting, Streamlining, Innovating. And of course You think you can do better than that.</p>

			<p>You could build more applications and integrate more features which help you to measure, quantify and understand you and your surroundings. Or you throw away all of these shiny toys and go on a detox with a monk in the mountains of Tibet. Start complaining that everything was easier back in the days. Better could mean more of everything or less of everything—maybe both of it.</p>

			<p class="img_caption"> 2016, Subway, #SearchforBetter</p>

			<p>On this #SearchForBetter you find yourself seemingly disoriented, simultaneously thrilled—slightly anxious. You would like to look into the manifold ways of living which the age of possibilities holds prepared for you, how they increasingly put you in need to decide and design for yourself and of course how the big bad guys exploit this situation. Doing so you notice that you could actually give that Age a different name. Infact there are many names for the time you live in.</p>

				<p class="quote">“It is supposed to be the age of "industrial society" or "late capitalism" or "scientific and technical civilization," or the "atomic age"; it is supposed to be the age of the "work society" or the "leisure society" or the "information society"; it is supposed to be the age of "functional differentiation," or the "epoch of epochal breaks," or the "postconventional age," or the "post- European age" (already), or simply "modernity" (or even "postmodernity" already)—and so on.” (Odo Marquard, The Age of Unworldliness, 1984)</p><br>

			<h2>#SearchForBetterInTheAgeOfUnworldliness</h2>

			<p>For the german philosopher Odo Marquard, this speaks for a indirect form of anonymity, because of which we find ourselves in “a crisis of orientation”. You are not sure if he is right. Potentially that is the proof. Some people tell you: “You look at your phone, have full bars, but no connection. You like post-industrial spaces even though you’ve never seen industry firsthand. You are aware that your eyeballs act like agents. You spend your hours syncing, sorting out the inner life of objects. That moment of intimacy when you look into the eyes of someone who is looking at you on a screen. The world has never felt more radically left or more right-wing reactionary. You are not your shirt or your religious affiliation. Transparency can’t hide the shade.” You are not sure what all that means exactly but it sounds legit, dystopian with a slight hunch of utopia. For Marquard, our time is also what he calls “The Age of Unworldliness”. And it is this interplay between Utopias and Apocalypses, where immediate expectation of either heaven or hell on earth form our perception of reality.</p>

			<p>In this idea of progress we compose big ideas. “The idea of mankind's self-improvement or even self-perfection: Everything gets better and better faster and faster, and may even soon, finally, really become good.” The old is replaced by the new, and the stupid by the smart, which is to say, concretely, the raw veggies which are surpassed by the mashed.</p>

				<p class="quote">“In short, the earlier, which is underage and immature, is surpassed by the later, which is adult and mature, and by the latest, which is most adult and most mature.”</p>

			<p>So you could say that you are busily engaged in not being a child anymore, because the adults are allowed to do all the fun stuff you continually want to become more grown-up. At the same time everything is so much easier as a child. And the world of your frazzled parents is so fucked up. All those great ideas you had—they tear em apart. They expose you, as not significant. You can either go into flight or fight mode. But it will not stop them from shutting you down.</p>

			<p>From that perspective our ideas of the modern world become a self-fulfilling prophecy. “The idea of decadence and downfall, of mankind's self-destruction or even self-annihilation: Everything gets worse and worse faster and faster, and may even very soon, finally, really become fatal.” There is nothing new in your inbox, even if the latter is sometimes obscured by spam. For Maquard the attempt of leaving childhood behind, the pattern of increasing maturity is the same, it is just looked at from another angle. Where we previously cheered like children cutting cake at a birthday party we now moan like an exhausted deliveroo rider facing flexible working hours and no tip for cake. Hope is replaced by fear.</p>

				<p class="quote">“Seen in the perspective of catastrophe, the history of the world is the history of the decline that the loss of childlikeness represents.”</p>

			<p>Do we actually grow up? What happened in the 18th century is what is called the Discovery of the Child. Since then, Marquard says the child is regarded as the actual human, more pure and authentic. More cheer, less moan. In that idea, children and youth define the new standard for what it means to be human. With the applause of your parents, you now practice the revolt—No more stale veggies, no more nine to five, no more survival, more self-fulfillment.</p>

				<p class="quote">“We do not lack childlikeness, rather, we have too much of it; for the rule, with human beings in the modern world, is that they no longer grow up, because this is the age of unworldliness.”</p>

			<p>Eventually that bears certain uncertainties. Where everything changes ever faster, experiences fade. We rely on secondhand-experiences and base our beliefs more and more on hearsay. And when school is never over the kids start getting restless, because they want to go home. Your perception of reality blurs in with fiction. Fictions and expectation of a more peaceful place, where belonging frees you from this demanding reality. Belong anywhere. Don’t think that this would be it. The long tail comes with a bunch of more issues at hand. But your willingness to accept Illusion might save you those for now. </p>

			<p class="img_caption"> 2013, K-Hole, Normcore: the report that started it all…?</p>

			<h2>On a Report on Freedom</h2>

			<p>Instead look at what you can actually do while being a child, forever stuck in youth mode. In 2013 the self-described trend forecasting group K-Hole published an essay called "Youth Mode: A Report on Freedom“. They describe „Normcore“ as „a path to a more peaceful life“. Normcore as a fashion trend has never moved away ever since. K-Hole talks about the term as an attitude rather than a fashion trend. In the idea of mass individualism we became so tired of finding new ways of defining our individuality because there are just too many to keep up with and because it would render you into such a weirdo that no-one would like to hang out with you anymore if you would explore them all.</p>

</div>
			<img class='backtxt' src="images/darm.svg">
<div class="maintxt">

			<p>Normcore comes as the solution to these problems. Instead of being all special we all are the same. And because we are all the same we are also all back together. No reason to  stress, we are still all different, we don't have to wear the same clothes and our minds are complex. But now we have the right to wear a handlebar mustache, devote to artisanal pickling today and to have a Big Mac after the Yoga class tomorrow.</p>

				<p class="quote">„To be truly Normcore, you need to understand that there’s no such thing as normal."</p>

			<p>And it is important to not confuse Normcore with acting basic. That is what Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg, or Doug Funnie do. Because as K-Hole says: „sameness is not minimalism“–and especially not repetition. Wearing always the same is a simple solution but opts out all the fun of the endless choices you already have in your wardrobe. Black turtlenecks and the grey T-shirts of Mark Zuckerberg stand in one line with the iPhone evolution from 2007 till now and the never ending crave for improvement.</p>

			<p class="img_caption"> 2016, Mark for H&M, As few decisions as possible</p>

			<p>But with an iPhone your battery stays empty—constant need for new energy. And an iPhone with an empty battery is like no phone. You can hear Zarathustra whispering in the wind from here. The NoPhone describes a moment in which you are unsure if you got the joke because you are wondering why their makers actually have to step up on the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_PGY5kmrg0">TED stage</a> to explain it. Chances are that most one size fits all solutions will always taste bland in the end. That goes for binge watching, bulk buying and pre cooking as well as for your monthly package of clothing. The time you gain will be spent on making an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94fMJYG00nI">Unboxing Video</a> anyway and you will be the one who either makes it or watches it. Having more time does not necessarily mean more fun, your friends still have to work till 7 if they don't have to do extra hours.</p>

			<p class="img_caption">LOT 0030 — briefs; black stretch-cotton jersey; 93% cotton, 7% elastane</p>

			<p>So what is in question, seems to be the practicality of that time gain. The branding of these products feeds into that. Less choice, more time for leisure, more time for work, <a target="_blank" href="https://vimeo.com/162516974">simply more</a> time for other things. But what to do actually? Netflix does not produce fast enough for that and my meditation practice already takes three hours daily.</p>

				<p class="quote">“What to do? Breakfast wasn’t an issue. Neither was lunch. I had work to do, but I didn’t want to do it, so I went out for coffee. On the way there, I passed my neighborhood bagel place, where I saw someone ordering my usual breakfast: a bagel with butter. I watched with envy. I wasn’t hungry, and I knew that I was better off than the bagel eater: the Soylent was cheaper, and it had provided me with fewer empty calories and much better nutrition. Buttered bagels aren’t even that great; I shouldn’t be eating them.” </p>

			<p>So why buy the product if it doesn't matter any more. For the prestige? For the statement? Just keep the packaging. I am studying graphic design and collect fancy packaging for my shelves too. If that is the joke then it is no wonder that it has been made by artists and designers. Ryder Ripps made the branding for Soylent and also for Abacus a dietary supplement in pill form. Where the branding of Soylent stays consistently somewhere between resembling a nutrition facts table and an Innocent smoothie, the branding of Abacus Pills feels slightly more eerie and creates another No Phone like moment. Is this sincere? Is this a hoax? Is that meant to make me anxious? Is it meant to help me? Is it critique directed towards me as a consumer or have you become self-aware about your product?</p>

			<p>“Hacking vs. Defaults” shows precisely that tension. Although Guthrie Lonergan comments on how the “ethos of internet-based art practices have evolved”, the “???” stays open for interpretation. But clearly shows two kinds of mentalities which seem to be at work, for whatever they might be applied.</p>

				<p class="quote">“It's hard to pin down that "???," even within such a specific thing as Nasty Nets, and the people involved with Nasty Nets... I think a lot of these artists are going in subtly different directions, though we share an interest in what the Internet has done to us, how it affects culture and consciousness”</p>

			<p>Some stick with net.art some go for post-internet some make ads. Borders and mentalities stay fluid…mostly? (Transition Needed) Yet I would say for the 2009 Berlin Biennale, DIS went mostly for being and critiquing the people instead of empowering them.</p>

				<p class="quote">“Our proposition is simple: Instead of holding talks on anxiety, let’s make people anxious. Rather than organizing symposia on privacy, let’s jeopardize it. Let’s give a body to the problems of the present where they occur so as to make them a matter of agency—not spectatorship.”— DIS Magazine, The Present in Drag</p>

			<p>Sounds fun. But that eerie feeling again numbs after a while and the matter of agency that comes with it will fade due to long term exposure. Complaining is not an answer to my/our/your problems neither it is a question. Maybe I should stop complaining. I don't have an answer either. But is it not possible to be somewhere in the middle between the two columns of Lonergan's diagram? Shining light on a topic from more than one angle and let them contradict each other? Something like, critiquing TED while giving a TED-talk? Or hijacking the startup scene but still producing something useful?</p>

			<p>Normcore finally accepts that inconsistency in your lifestyle. K-Hole says our consumer choices are temporary anyway and our conflicting choices do not expose us as inauthentic hypocrites but complex beings. Because:“Normcore capitalizes on the possibility of misinterpretation as an opportunity for connection—not as a threat to authenticity.“ That can not only be applied to us as consumers but also as producers. And when everyone is a designer anyway, it is this moment when things get slippery.</p>

			<h2>Manuel Bürger—Slippery Design, 2013</h2>

			<p>What is called Slippery Design, is the mindset for us all—the multitude of amateurs, produsers, designerz. A design essay, practice, manifest published by Manuel Bürger in 2013. On slippery ground balance and order are defied. The void opens for dissemination, may it be through irritation, mutation or failure. Empowered to be truly virtuosic masters in this form of writing and reading, we scrape out the last bits of syllables from the bottom of our semiotic pans. Discourse is not an option in that matter.</p>
